# Sentiment_Analysis

With the exponential growth of social media platforms, vast amounts of opinion-rich data are generated daily. This project aims to build a sentiment analysis model that processes and classifies tweets into sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral). The system leverages machine learning/NLP techniques to clean, vectorize, and analyze the textual data, allowing for better understanding of user attitudes and trends, which can be valuable for brand monitoring, political campaigns, or public policy decisions.
